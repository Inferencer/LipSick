## Introduction

#### To get started with LipSick on Linux, follow these steps to set up your environment. This branch has been tested with HuggingFace spaces which runs Linux using Python 3.10 and CUDA 12.3.2.

## Setup

<details>
  <summary>Install</summary>

1. Clone the repository:
```python
git clone -b linux https://github.com/Inferencer/LipSick.git
cd LipSick
```
2. Create and activate the Anaconda environment:
```python
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate lipsick
```

## Download pre-trained models
<details>
  <summary>Download Links</summary>

### For the folder ./asserts

Please download pretrained_lipsick.pth using this [link](https://github.com/Inferencer/LipSick/releases/download/v1PretrainedModels/pretrained_lipsick.pth) and place the file in the folder ./asserts

Then, download output_graph.pb using this [link](https://github.com/Inferencer/LipSick/releases/download/v1PretrainedModels/output_graph.pb) and place the file in the same folder.

### For the folder ./models

Please download shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat using this [link](https://github.com/Inferencer/LipSick/releases/download/v1PretrainedModels/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat) and place the file in the folder ./models
</details>

### The folder structure for manually downloaded models
```python
.
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ asserts                        
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ examples                   # A place to store inputs if not using gradio UI
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ inference_result           # Results will be saved to this folder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ output_graph.pb            # The DeepSpeech model you manually download and place here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pretrained_lipsick.pth     # Pre-trained model you manually download and place here
â”‚                   
â”œâ”€â”€ models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Discriminator.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LipSick.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat  # Dlib Landmark tracking model you manually download and place here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Syncnet.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ VGG19.py   
â””â”€â”€ ...
```
4. Run the application:
```python
python app.py
```


This will launch a Gradio interface where you can upload your video and audio files to process them with LipSick.
Changelog




### To-Do List

- [ ] Add support MacOS.
- [ ] Add upscale reference frames with masking. 
- [ ] Add seamless clone masking to remove the common bounding box around mouths. ðŸ¤•
- [ ] Add alternative option for face tracking model [SFD](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment) (likely best results, but slower than Dlib).
- [ ] Add custom reference frame feature. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Add auto persistent crop_radius to prevent mask flickering. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Examine CPU speed upgrades.
- [ ] Reintroduce persistent folders for frame extraction as an option with existing frame checks for faster extraction on commonly used videos. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Provide HuggingFace space CPU (free usage but slower). ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Provide Google Colab .IPYNB. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Add support for Linux. ðŸ¤¢
- [ ] Release Tutorial on manual masking using DaVinci. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Looped original video generated as an option for faster manual masking. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Image to MP4 conversion so a single image can be used as input.
- [ ] Automatic audio conversion to WAV regardless of input audio format.
- [ ] Clean README.md & provide command line inference.
- [ ] Remove input video 25fps requirement.
- [ ] Upload cherry picked input footage for user download & use.
- [ ] Create a Discord to share results, faster help, suggestions & cherry picked input footage.
- [ ] Upload results footage montage to GitHub so new users can see what LipSick is capable of.
- [x] Provide HuggingFace space GPU. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Remove warning messages in command prompt that don't affect performance. ðŸ¤¢
- [x] Moved frame extraction to temp folders. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Results with the same input video name no longer overwrite existing results. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Remove OpenFace CSV requirement. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Detect accepted media input formats only. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Upgrade to Python 3.10. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Add UI. ðŸ¤®

### Key:
- ðŸ¤® = Completed & published
- ðŸ¤¢ = Completed & published but requires community testing
- ðŸ˜· = Tested & working but not published yet
- ðŸ¤• = Tested but not ready for public use
### Simple Key:
