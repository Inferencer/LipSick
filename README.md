Currently only accepting .wav seems there is an error in the audio conversion on HF, dlib is also struggling with glasses

you can just duplicate the [space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Inferencer/LipSick) and select the paid hardware Nvidia T4 small is 
the smallest GPU HuggingFace offers which is $0.40/hour charging each minute of uptime regardless of GPU usage unless you pause the space.

I will also upload a HuggingFace CPU branch that will be free but is much slower ðŸ¤®

## How to Setup

### Important! 
Set your space to private, or users will keep restarting your sleeping space and you will be charged.

#### Step 1: Duplicate the Space
Select the 3 dots on the top right of the space then click "Duplicate Space" from the dropdown.

#### Step 2: Select Your Hardware
I recommend the cheapest GPU, which is NVIDIA T4 small.

### To-Do List

- [ ] Add support MacOS.
- [ ] Add upscale reference frames with masking. 
- [ ] Add seamless clone masking to remove the common bounding box around mouths. ðŸ¤•
- [ ] Add alternative option for face tracking model [SFD](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment) (likely best results, but slower than Dlib).
- [ ] Add custom reference frame feature. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Add auto persistent crop_radius to prevent mask flickering. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Examine CPU speed upgrades.
- [ ] Reintroduce persistent folders for frame extraction as an option with existing frame checks for faster extraction on commonly used videos. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Provide HuggingFace space CPU (free usage but slower). ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Provide Google Colab .IPYNB. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Add support for Linux. ðŸ¤¢
- [ ] Release Tutorial on manual masking using DaVinci. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Looped original video generated as an option for faster manual masking. ðŸ˜·
- [ ] Image to MP4 conversion so a single image can be used as input.
- [ ] Automatic audio conversion to WAV regardless of input audio format.
- [ ] Clean README.md & provide command line inference.
- [ ] Remove input video 25fps requirement.
- [ ] Upload cherry picked input footage for user download & use.
- [ ] Create a Discord to share results, faster help, suggestions & cherry picked input footage.
- [ ] Upload results footage montage to GitHub so new users can see what LipSick is capable of.
- [x] Provide HuggingFace space GPU. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Remove warning messages in command prompt that don't affect performance. ðŸ¤¢
- [x] Moved frame extraction to temp folders. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Results with the same input video name no longer overwrite existing results. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Remove OpenFace CSV requirement. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Detect accepted media input formats only. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Upgrade to Python 3.10. ðŸ¤®
- [x] Add UI. ðŸ¤®
